### Chapter 1: Disaster

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A passenger car on a New York city subway train is packed full around 6 pm, dimly lit. A business man in his late 40s, standing, headed home after a long day at work, his tie is untied and suit coat unbuttoned; an assembly line operator no older than 30, sitting, hot and sweaty from his long shift, still wearing his brown, dirty apron; and a strip dancer in her mid 20s, standing, on her way to a strip club are the closest to a young man in a grey, long sleeve shirt and jeans, sitting, about 19, on his home from class at collage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the young man gazes at business man's tie, deep in thought, he hears the train crash into something. He sees the passengers around him get thrown backwards and injured in the process. He stands up and scrambles to the business man to try to help him, who hit his head on one of the seats, blood streaming down his face from a cut across his left forehead about an inch long. Then the young man blinked.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he open his eyes, he was back where he sat and everyone else was also back where there were. He realized what he just saw hadn't happened. He quickly stood up and in a loud voice said, "Brace for impact!" He then braced himself against the nearest pole. Those around him thought he was crazy, and did not heed his warning. In a few seconds the train crashed, just as he saw it. Everyone who heard him were astounded. He then bolted to the business man, just as he did in the vision.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi, my name is Lysander, how can I help?" Lysander asked the business man as the assembly line operator called 911.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm Forest," answered Forest. "You can help by trying to stop the bleeding."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," Lysander replied as he tore of the end of his left sleeve and used it to apply pressure to the cut.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Forest responded, taking the cloth and applying pressure himself as the assembly line operator checked the stripper, but she had already departed. "Go help others, I'll be fine."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you might have a concussion," Lysander cautioned as the assembly line operator went to help some else a bit farther off. "I'll stay with you until the paramedics arrive."

### Chapter 2: After Math

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysander focussed on Forest's forehead and thought of nothing else. After about 20 seconds he started to recognize the individual cells. As he continued to concentrate, he could identify the various molecules. As he examined, he detect some microscopic damage around his brain, some of the membranes anchoring his brain had tiny tears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm almost certain you have a concussion," Lysander confirmed. The paramedics had arrived and began to help those they could reach first. He alerted them, "Hey, I have a concussion over here."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two paramedics came over to help and one asked, "how do you know?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how; I just do," Lysander fibbed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you about the crash?" Forest asked Lysander as they took him to an ambulance. Lysander responed by rubbing his right index finger across his nose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysander got into an ambulance to get checked out at the hospital. He only had a few scrapes and bruises, but nothing serious. He was free to home.
